# Financial Model

#### Gross Income and Allocation (100%) = **5000 USDT/month**:

- **Team (65%)**:  
  \( 5000 \times 0.65 = 3250 \, \text{USDT} \)

- **Investors (20%)**:  
  \( 5000 \times 0.20 = 1000 \, \text{USDT} \)

- **Marketing and DAO (10%)**:  
  \( 5000 \times 0.10 = 500 \, \text{USDT} \)

- **Rewards (5%)**:  
  \( 5000 \times 0.05 = 250 \, \text{USDT} \)

---

### Staking of the Salary Fund (65%)
The salary fund will be staked between payouts. Assuming monthly payouts, staking income is calculated at **8–12% annually**.

- **Salary Fund Available for Staking**: **3250 USDT**  

**Annual Staking Income**:  
- At 8%:  
  \( 3250 \times 0.08 = 260 \, \text{USDT/year} \)  
- At 12%:  
  \( 3250 \times 0.12 = 390 \, \text{USDT/year} \)  

**Monthly Staking Income for Salary Fund**:  
- At 8%:  
  \( 260 \div 12 = 21.67 \, \text{USDT/month} \)  
- At 12%:  
  \( 390 \div 12 = 32.50 \, \text{USDT/month} \)  

---

### Annual Investor Income
Investors receive **20% of the net income**, which increases due to staking rewards from the **Rewards (5%)** and the **Salary Fund (65%)**.

1. **Base Net Income for Investors (Excluding Staking)**:  
   \( 60,000 \times 0.20 = 12,000 \, \text{USDT/year} \)  

2. **Staking Income from Rewards (5% = 3000 USDT)**:  
   - At 8%:  
     \( 3000 \times 0.08 = 240 \, \text{USDT/year} \)  
   - At 12%:  
     \( 3000 \times 0.12 = 360 \, \text{USDT/year} \)  

3. **Additional Staking Income from the Salary Fund (65%)**:  
   Investors receive **20% of the staking income from the salary fund**:  
   - At 8%:  
     \( 260 \times 0.20 = 52 \, \text{USDT/year} \)  
   - At 12%:  
     \( 390 \times 0.20 = 78 \, \text{USDT/year} \)  

---

### Final Investor Income with Staking:
- **At 8% Staking**:  
  \( 12,000 + 240 + 52 = 12,292 \, \text{USDT/year} \)  
- **At 12% Staking**:  
  \( 12,000 + 360 + 78 = 12,438 \, \text{USDT/year} \)  

---

### Key Notes:
1. **Quarterly Growth**:  
   Due to compounding effects and reinvestment, investors can expect incremental growth each quarter.  

2. **Volatility of Silver Rates**:  
   Silver, a key resource in the system, is subject to price fluctuations, which can affect overall returns. Regular monitoring and risk mitigation strategies are recommended.
